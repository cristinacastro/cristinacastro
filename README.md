### Hi everyone! 👋🏻

I’m Cris, a **Frontend developer with a background in Graphic Design**. I decided to merge my knowledge into web development to enjoy the process of transforming creative ideas into code and start a new career in a sector that is constantly evolving and is full of possibilities. 

I’ve recently graduated in **full-stack web development on Ironhack** and it let me confirm what I already suspected: I do enjoy programming. Now I want to keep training and learning more about web development.
